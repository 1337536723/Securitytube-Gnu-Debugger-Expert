2.) Simple program -> Write, compile and run
kan1shka9@dev:~/Desktop/GDB$ ls
main.c
kan1shka9@dev:~/Desktop/GDB$ gcc main.c -o main
kan1shka9@dev:~/Desktop/GDB$ ls
main  main.c
kan1shka9@dev:~/Desktop/GDB$ ./main
Hello to the world of GNU debugger!

3.) Debug using GDB
kan1shka9@dev:~/Desktop/GDB$ gdb ./main

(gdb)
Debug symbols are missing so need to recompile again suing the -ggdb option

4.) Compiling with -ggdb symbols
kan1shka9@dev:~/Desktop/GDB$ gcc -ggdb main.c -o main_with_debug
kan1shka9@dev:~/Desktop/GDB$ gcc main.c -o main_no_debug
kan1shka9@dev:~/Desktop/GDB$ ls
main.c  main_no_debug  main_with_debug
kan1shka9@dev:~/Desktop/GDB$ gdb ./main_with_debug

(gdb)
Now GDB has fired up with debug symbols
